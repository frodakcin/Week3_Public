# Week3 Challenge

## Mammogram_Analysis Challenge Notebook
Contains a notebook with the challenge details explained fully. In this challenge students classify segments of mammogram images as 0 (negative for abnormality) or 1 (positive for abnormality) or 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 in the multiclass problem (negative and varying types of abnormalities).

Dataset used in this challenge:
-  Mammogram images from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) and the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM (CBIS-DDSM). 
Both datasets are publicly available:
* DDSM - http://marathon.csee.usf.edu/Mammography/Database.html
* CBIS-DDSM - https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/CBIS-DDSM

Jpegs and labels were extracted from a tfrecords dataset curated by Eric Scuccimarra (https://www.kaggle.com/skooch)

## Classifier_Evaluation
- This is a Jupyter notebook containing a function that will evaluate each group's classifier results and report accuracy and f1 score

## test_binary_labels
- Contains the ground truth labels for the test data in the binary classification case. This is used only to evaluate the results of a model after it has been submitted by students. DO NOT MAKE THIS FILE PUBLIC.

## test_multiclass_labels
- Contains the ground truth labels for the test data in the multiclass classification case. This is used only to evaluate the results of a model after it has been submitted by students. DO NOT MAKE THIS FILE PUBLIC.

## Student Presentations
- Contains presentations students gave on their solutions to the challenge problem.
